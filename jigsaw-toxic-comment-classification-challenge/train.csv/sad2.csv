0097b052f0b68a96,"I felt optimistic when I saw the President's plan to tackle climate change by signing an Executive Order to cut carbon pollution from power plants. Cutting carbon pollution from power plants is one of the single most important steps the United States can take to reduce global warming and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The Administration's action is long overdue, and I applaud the President for taking this step.

But the Executive Order on its own is not enough. The President's proposal must be put into law. We need Congress to pass comprehensive legislation to cut carbon pollution and put a price on carbon, to help drive the clean energy economy forward. We need Congress to make a serious investment in clean energy, including investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean transportation. And we need Congress to make sure that low-income communities and communities of color are first in line for the clean energy jobs that will be created by a comprehensive climate bill.

That's why we need you to join the movement for climate action. Visit ClimateInteractive.org and tell President Obama to make a strong climate bill his legacy. Then, contact your members of Congress and urge them to support a strong climate bill.

Inaction on climate change is not an option. We need to pass a strong climate bill this year, and we need you to make it happen. Join the movement for climate action.

I am very pleased to announce that next week, The Climate Institute will release a new book, ""A Climate of Hope: How Cities, Businesses, and Citizens are Taking on Climate Change to Save the Planet.""

This book, written by myself and Tom Peterson, will be released on June 23. It tells the story of how climate action is happening in cities, states, and businesses across the country. It's the story of hope, of how we can create a new clean energy economy that creates good jobs, protects the health of our children, and keeps our planet safe.
